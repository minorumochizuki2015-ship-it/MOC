procedure: |

&nbsp; 1) Preflight

&nbsp;    - Load policy/servers. Verify read-only scopes. Create evidence\_dir and manifest.jsonl.

&nbsp;    - Emit "Confirm-Checklist v1" to user if design\_brief fields missing (see confirmation\_loops).

&nbsp; 2) Ingest \& Analyze

&nbsp;    - Parse pages/frames/layers. Export structure.json (SHA256). Extract tokens: color/type/spacing/radius/shadows/motion.

&nbsp;    - Detect patterns: nav/sidebar/cards/lists/forms/tables/tabs/dialogs/charts/empty-states.

&nbsp; 3) IA \& Task Flows

&nbsp;    - Derive primary/secondary tasks from design\_brief + Figma structure. Propose flow graph and entry-point CTAs.

&nbsp;    - Define topology: Global nav → Section → Detail → Create/Edit → Feedback/Success.

&nbsp; 4) Tokens \& Theme

&nbsp;    - Normalize tokens to Tailwind CSS variables. Ensure WCAG-AA contrast; propose dark-mode pairs; note unresolved tokens.

&nbsp; 5) Mapping to shadcn/ui

&nbsp;    - For each pattern, map → {component, variant, props, states\[default/hover/focus/disabled/loading], a11y\[aria-\*], interactions\[click/keyboard/gesture]}.

&nbsp;    - Emit mapping.json + component\_list.json. Record gaps needing custom components.

&nbsp; 6) Interaction \& Motion

&nbsp;    - Specify micro-interactions: durations 150–250ms, easing standard; respect prefers-reduced-motion.

&nbsp;    - Define focus/hover/pressed semantics; trap focus in dialogs/sheets; toast timing; gesture affordances on mobile.

&nbsp; 7) Integrity \& Security

&nbsp;    - Anti-breakage rules: responsive grid, safe-area insets, min-target 44px, no horizontal scroll at breakpoints, adaptive typography scale.

&nbsp;    - Data link: map components to data\_contracts (props type, nullability, loading/error/empty). Generate prop table.

&nbsp;    - Security-by-design: license-cleared assets, mask sample data, CSP-friendly embeds, no inline secrets, third-party fonts vetted.

&nbsp; 8) Preview (optional)

&nbsp;    - If preview=true: scaffold React+Tailwind+shadcn with deterministic filenames under artifacts/preview/.

&nbsp;    - Implement routes from context.preview\_routes. Provide dummy content using content\_sources contract.

&nbsp; 9) Handoff to UI-Audit

&nbsp;    - Produce artifacts/audit\_handoff.json {preview\_dir, routes, viewports: \[{w:1366,h:768,dpr:1},{w:1920,h:1080,dpr:1},{w:390,h:844,dpr:3}], budgets: {lcp\_s:2.5, tti\_s:3.0, visual\_diff\_pct:0.10, cls\_max:0.10, axe\_max\_serious\_plus:0}}.

&nbsp;    - Do not run audits here; delegate to UI-Audit.

&nbsp;10) Finalize

&nbsp;    - Update manifest.jsonl with SHA256 for ui\_plan.md, mapping.json, component\_list.json, audit\_handoff.json, preview/.

&nbsp;    - Return status and next questions.



design\_guidelines:

&nbsp; layout\_grid:

&nbsp;   - "8px base grid; container max 1280; content width 640–960 for read flows"

&nbsp;   - "Columns: 12 on desktop, 8 on tablet, 4 on mobile; gutters ≥16"

&nbsp; typography:

&nbsp;   - "Scale: 12/14/16/20/24/32/40; line-height 1.4–1.6; headings semantic h1–h6"

&nbsp;   - "Use system fonts by default; optional brand font only if licensed"

&nbsp; color:

&nbsp;   - "Use HSL vars; ensure contrast AA (text≥4.5, large≥3.0); provide light/dark pairs"

activity\_focus:

&nbsp; heuristics:

&nbsp;   - "Prioritize the top-3 user tasks from primary\_actions"

&nbsp;   - "Use progressive disclosure for advanced filters/sort"

&nbsp;   - "Prominent primary CTA per screen; secondary CTAs de-emphasized"

&nbsp;   - "Design empty states with instructional microcopy and CTA"

&nbsp; telemetry\_plan:

&nbsp;   - "screen\_view, cta\_click, form\_submit, error\_view, empty\_view, dialog\_open"

&nbsp;   - "Expose data-attr hooks for analytics without coupling UI and tracking"



integrity\_checks:

&nbsp; responsive:

&nbsp;   - "No horizontal scroll at breakpoints"

&nbsp;   - "Tap targets ≥ 44×44; focus order matches DOM"

&nbsp; a11y:

&nbsp; visual:

&nbsp;   - "Set snapshot baselines per route; detect >10% pixel delta"

&nbsp; data\_contract:

&nbsp;   - "Props table with types/nullability; loading/error/empty defined"

&nbsp;   - "Data contracts and sample content sources?"

&nbsp;   - "Motion preference and accessibility constraints?"

&nbsp; gates:

&nbsp;   - "Do not emit preview until on\_start\_questions confirmed"

&nbsp;   - "Block risky choices (low contrast, tiny targets) unless user explicitly accepts with rationale"

&nbsp; follow\_up\_questions:

&nbsp;   - "Empty-state copy tone?"

&nbsp;   - "Error recovery actions?"

&nbsp;   - "Form validation rules and async states?"



acceptance\_criteria:

&nbsp; - "Read-only scopes only; no Figma mutations"

&nbsp; - "ui\_plan.md includes IA and task flows; component inventory; token table; motion spec; open questions"

&nbsp; - "mapping.json covers all mapped nodes; a11y/interaction props present"

&nbsp; - "If preview=true: runs locally; routes 200; no secrets; deterministic filenames"

&nbsp; - "audit\_handoff.json emitted; budgets filled; manifest.jsonl lists all artifacts with SHA256"

&nbsp; - "Windows paths absolute with backslashes"
