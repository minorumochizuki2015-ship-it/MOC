Good, bad, or indifferent, these\npapers were in a jargon that only my colleagues and a few advanced\nstudents could understand. Hence, when I was asked to do this little\nbook, I soon found it extremely difficult to say what I meant in simple\nfashion. The style is new to me, but I hope the reader will not find it\nforced or pedantic; at least I have done my very best to tell the story\nsimply and clearly.\n\nMany friends have aided in the preparation of the book. The whimsical\ncharm of Miss Susan Richert�s illustrations add enormously to the\nspirit I wanted. She gave freely of her own time on the drawings and\nin planning the book with me. My colleagues at the University of\nChicago, especially Professor Wilton M. Krogman (now of the University\nof Pennsylvania), and also Mrs. Linda Braidwood, Associate of the\nOriental Institute, and Professors Fay-Cooper Cole and Sol Tax, of\nthe Department of Anthropology, gave me counsel in matters bearing on\ntheir special fields, and the Department of Anthropology bore some of\nthe expense of the illustrations. From Mrs. Irma Hunter and Mr. Arnold\nMaremont, who are not archeologists at all and have only an intelligent\nlayman�s notion of archeology, I had sound advice on how best to tell\nthe story. I am deeply indebted to all these friends.\n\nWhile I was preparing the second edition, I had the great fortune\nto be able to rework the third chapter with Professor Sherwood L.\nWashburn, now of the Department of Anthropology of the University of\nCalifornia, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters with Professor\nHallum L. Movius, Jr., of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University. The\nbook has gained greatly in accuracy thereby. In matters of dating,\nProfessor Movius and the indications of Professor W. F. Libby�s Carbon\n14 chronology project have both encouraged me to choose the lowest\ndates now current for the events of the Pleistocene Ice Age. There is\nstill no certain way of fixing a direct chronology for most of the\nPleistocene, but Professor Libby�s method appears very promising for\nits end range and for proto-historic dates. In any case, this book\nnames �periods,� and new dates may be written in against mine, if new\nand better dating systems appear.\n\nI wish to thank Dr. Clifford C. Gregg, Director of Chicago Natural\nHistory Museum, for the opportunity to publish this book. My old\nfriend, Dr. Paul S. Martin, Chief Curator in the Department of\nAnthropology, asked me to undertake the job and inspired me to complete\nit. I am also indebted to Miss Lillian A. Ross, Associate Editor of\nScientific Publications, and to Mr. George I. Quimby, Curator of\nExhibits in Anthropology, for all the time they have given me in\ngetting the manuscript into proper shape.\n\n            ROBERT J.

I have picked the brains of Professor F.\nClark Howell of the Department of Anthropology of the University of\nChicago in reworking the earlier chapters, and he was very patient in\nthe matter, which I sincerely appreciate.\n\nAll of Mrs. Susan Richert Allen�s original drawings appear, but a few\nnecessary corrections have been made in some of the charts and some new\ndrawings have been added by Mr. John Pfiffner, Staff Artist, Chicago\nNatural History Museum.\n\n            ROBERT J.

Actually, more\nthan 99 per cent of man�s story is prehistory. Man is at least half a\nmillion years old, but he did not begin to write history (or to write\nanything) until about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe men who lived in prehistoric times left us no history books, but\nthey did unintentionally leave a record of their presence and their way\nof life. This record is studied and interpreted by different kinds of\nscientists.\n\n\nSCIENTISTS WHO FIND OUT ABOUT PREHISTORIC MEN\n\nThe scientists who study the bones and teeth and any other parts\nthey find of the bodies of prehistoric men, are called _physical\nanthropologists_. Physical anthropologists are trained, much like\ndoctors, to know all about the human body. They study living people,\ntoo; they know more about the biological facts of human �races� than\nanybody else. If the police find a badly decayed body in a trunk,\nthey ask a physical anthropologist to tell them what the person\noriginally looked like. The physical anthropologists who specialize in\nprehistoric men work with fossils, so they are sometimes called _human\npaleontologists_.\n\n\nARCHEOLOGISTS\n\nThere is a kind of scientist who studies the things that prehistoric\nmen made and did. Such a scientist is called an _archeologist_. It is\nthe archeologist�s business to look for the stone and metal tools, the\npottery, the graves, and the caves or huts of the men who lived before\nhistory began.\n\nBut there is more to archeology than just looking for things. In\nProfessor V. Gordon Childe�s words, archeology �furnishes a sort of\nhistory of human activity, provided always that the actions have\nproduced concrete results and left recognizable material traces.� You\nwill see that there are at least three points in what Childe says:\n\n  1. The archeologists have to find the traces of things left behind by\n     ancient man, and\n\n  2. Only a few objects may be found, for most of these were probably\n     too soft or too breakable to last through the years. However,\n\n  3. The archeologist must use whatever he can find to tell a story--to\n     make a �sort of history�--from the objects and living-places and\n     graves that have escaped destruction.\n\nWhat I mean is this: Let us say you are walking through a dump yard,\nand you find a rusty old spark plug. If you want to think about what\nthe spark plug means, you quickly remember that it is a part of an\nautomobile motor. This tells you something about the man who threw\nthe spark plug on the dump. He either had an automobile, or he knew\nor lived near someone who did. He can�t have lived so very long ago,\nyou�ll remember, because spark plugs and automobiles are only about\nsixty years old.\n\nWhen you think about the old spark plug in this way you have\njust been making the beginnings of what we call an archeological\n_interpretation_; you have been making the spark plug tell a story.\nIt is the same way with the man-made things we archeologists find\nand put in museums. Usually, only a few of these objects are pretty\nto look at; but each of them has some sort of story to tell. Making\nthe interpretation of his finds is the most important part of the\narcheologist�s job. It is the way he gets at the �sort of history of\nhuman activity� which is expected of archeology.\n\n\nSOME OTHER SCIENTISTS\n\nThere are many other scientists who help the archeologist and the\nphysical anthropologist find out about prehistoric men. The geologists\nhelp us tell the age of the rocks or caves or gravel beds in which\nhuman bones or man-made objects are found. There are other scientists\nwith names which all begin with �paleo� (the Greek word for �old�). The\n_paleontologists_ study fossil animals. There are also, for example,\nsuch scientists as _paleobotanists_ and _paleoclimatologists_, who\nstudy ancient plants and climates. These scientists help us to know\nthe kinds of animals and plants that were living in prehistoric times\nand so could be used for food by ancient man; what the weather was\nlike; and whether there were glaciers. Also, when I tell you that\nprehistoric men did not appear until long after the great dinosaurs had\ndisappeared, I go on the say-so of the paleontologists. They know that\nfossils of men and of dinosaurs are not found in the same geological\nperiod. The dinosaur fossils come in early periods, the fossils of men\nmuch later.\n\nSince World War II even the atomic scientists have been helping the\narcheologists. By testing the amount of radioactivity left in charcoal,\nwood, or other vegetable matter obtained from archeological sites, they\nhave been able to date the sites. Shell has been used also, and even\nthe hair of Egyptian mummies. The dates of geological and climatic\nevents have also been discovered. Some of this work has been done from\ndrillings taken from the bottom of the sea.\n\nThis dating by radioactivity has considerably shortened the dates which\nthe archeologists used to give. If you find that some of the dates\nI give here are more recent than the dates you see in other books\non prehistory, it is because I am using one of the new lower dating\nsystems.\n\n[Illustration: RADIOCARBON CHART\n\nThe rate of disappearance of radioactivity as time passes.[1]]\n\n  [1] It is important that the limitations of the radioactive carbon\n      �dating� system be held in mind. As the statistics involved in\n      the system are used, there are two chances in three that the\n      �date� of the sample falls within the range given as plus or\n      minus an added number of years. For example, the �date� for the\n      Jarmo village (see chart), given as 6750 � 200 B.C., really\n      means that there are only two chances in three that the real\n      date of the charcoal sampled fell between 6950 and 6550 B.C.\n      We have also begun to suspect that there are ways in which the\n      samples themselves may have become �contaminated,� either on\n      the early or on the late side. We now tend to be suspicious of\n      single radioactive carbon determinations, or of determinations\n      from one site alone. But as a fabric of consistent\n      determinations for several or more sites of one archeological\n      period, we gain confidence in the dates.\n\n\nHOW THE SCIENTISTS FIND OUT\n\nSo far, this chapter has been mainly about the people who find out\nabout prehistoric men. We also need a word about _how_ they find out.\n\nAll our finds came by accident until about a hundred years ago. Men\ndigging wells, or digging in caves for fertilizer, often turned up\nancient swords or pots or stone arrowheads. People also found some odd\npieces of stone that didn�t look like natural forms, but they also\ndidn�t look like any known tool. As a result, the people who found them\ngave them queer names; for example, �thunderbolts.� The people thought\nthe strange stones came to earth as bolts of lightning. We know now\nthat these strange stones were prehistoric stone tools.\n\nMany important finds still come to us by accident. In 1935, a British\ndentist, A. T. Marston, found the first of two fragments of a very\nimportant fossil human skull, in a gravel pit at Swanscombe, on the\nRiver Thames, England. He had to wait nine months, until the face of\nthe gravel pit had been dug eight yards farther back, before the second\nfragment appeared. They fitted! Then, twenty years later, still another\npiece appeared. In 1928 workmen who were blasting out rock for the\nbreakwater in the port of Haifa began to notice flint tools. Thus the\nstory of cave men on Mount Carmel, in Palestine, began to be known.\n\nPlanned archeological digging is only about a century old. Even before\nthis, however, a few men realized the significance of objects they dug\nfrom the ground; one of these early archeologists was our own Thomas\nJefferson. The first real mound-digger was a German grocer�s clerk,\nHeinrich Schliemann. Schliemann made a fortune as a merchant, first\nin Europe and then in the California gold-rush of 1849. He became an\nAmerican citizen. Then he retired and had both money and time to test\nan old idea of his. He believed that the heroes of ancient Troy and\nMycenae were once real Trojans and Greeks. He proved it by going to\nTurkey and Greece and digging up the remains of both cities.\n\nSchliemann had the great good fortune to find rich and spectacular\ntreasures, and he also had the common sense to keep notes and make\ndescriptions of what he found. He proved beyond doubt that many ancient\ncity mounds can be _stratified_. This means that there may be the\nremains of many towns in a mound, one above another, like layers in a\ncake.\n\nYou might like to have an idea of how mounds come to be in layers.\nThe original settlers may have chosen the spot because it had a good\nspring and there were good fertile lands nearby, or perhaps because\nit was close to some road or river or harbor. These settlers probably\nbuilt their town of stone and mud-brick. Finally, something would have\nhappened to the town--a flood, or a burning, or a raid by enemies--and\nthe walls of the houses would have fallen in or would have melted down\nas mud in the rain. Nothing would have remained but the mud and debris\nof a low mound of _one_ layer.\n\nThe second settlers would have wanted the spot for the same reasons\nthe first settlers did--good water, land, and roads. Also, the second\nsettlers would have found a nice low mound to build their houses on,\na protection from floods. But again, something would finally have\nhappened to the second town, and the walls of _its_ houses would have\ncome tumbling down. This makes the _second_ layer. And so on....\n\nIn Syria I once had the good fortune to dig on a large mound that had\nno less than fifteen layers. Also, most of the layers were thick, and\nthere were signs of rebuilding and repairs within each layer. The mound\nwas more than a hundred feet high. In each layer, the building material\nused had been a soft, unbaked mud-brick, and most of the debris\nconsisted of fallen or rain-melted mud from these mud-bricks.\n\nThis idea of _stratification_, like the cake layers, was already a\nfamiliar one to the geologists by Schliemann�s time. They could show\nthat their lowest layer of rock was oldest or earliest, and that the\noverlying layers became more recent as one moved upward. Schliemann�s\ndigging proved the same thing at Troy. His first (lowest and earliest)\ncity had at least nine layers above it; he thought that the second\nlayer contained the remains of Homer�s Troy. We now know that Homeric\nTroy was layer VIIa from the bottom; also, we count eleven layers or\nsub-layers in total.\n\nSchliemann�s work marks the beginnings of modern archeology. Scholars\nsoon set out to dig on ancient sites, from Egypt to Central America.\n\n\nARCHEOLOGICAL INFORMATION\n\nAs time went on, the study of archeological materials--found either\nby accident or by digging on purpose--began to show certain things.\nArcheologists began to get ideas as to the kinds of objects that\nbelonged together. If you compared a mail-order catalogue of 1890 with\none of today, you would see a lot of differences. If you really studied\nthe two catalogues hard, you would also begin to see that certain\nobjects �go together.� Horseshoes and metal buggy tires and pieces of\nharness would begin to fit into a picture with certain kinds of coal\nstoves and furniture and china dishes and kerosene lamps. Our friend\nthe spark plug, and radios and electric refrigerators and light bulbs\nwould fit into a picture with different kinds of furniture and dishes\nand tools. You won�t be old enough to remember the kind of hats that\nwomen wore in 1890, but you�ve probably seen pictures of them, and you\nknow very well they couldn�t be worn with the fashions of today.\n\nThis is one of the ways that archeologists study their materials.\nThe various tools and weapons and jewelry, the pottery, the kinds\nof houses, and even the ways of burying the dead tend to fit into\npictures. Some archeologists call all of the things that go together to\nmake such a picture an _assemblage_. The assemblage of the first layer\nof Schliemann�s Troy was as different from that of the seventh layer as\nour 1900 mail-order catalogue is from the one of today.\n\nThe archeologists who came after Schliemann began to notice other\nthings and to compare them with occurrences in modern times. The\nidea that people will buy better mousetraps goes back into very\nancient times. Today, if we make good automobiles or radios, we can\nsell some of them in Turkey or even in Timbuktu. This means that a\nfew present-day types of American automobiles and radios form part\nof present-day �assemblages� in both Turkey and Timbuktu. The total\npresent-day �assemblage� of Turkey is quite different from that of\nTimbuktu or that of America, but they have at least some automobiles\nand some radios in common.\n\nNow these automobiles and radios will eventually wear out. Let us\nsuppose we could go to some remote part of Turkey or to Timbuktu in a\ndream. We don�t know what the date is, in our dream, but we see all\nsorts of strange things and ways of living in both places. Nobody\ntells us what the date is. But suddenly we see a 1936 Ford; so we\nknow that in our dream it has to be a", "chars": 20000}
